This is a collection of classes being built up to a framework for making 2D videogames in Flash. Included tools will be a dynamic physics engine, AI and Pathfinding engines, general geometry and math utilities along with much more.


WARNING - code is in very prealpha stage. A lot of stuff is not functioning at the moment. Things like the animation and ai packages aren't functional at all, and random bugs may occur throughout the project that I do not know of yet.

Once this project reaches what I the author consider a functional stage I will begin documenting issues and resolving them along the way.
